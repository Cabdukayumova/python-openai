Here you can find how to use OpenAI API with Python and use Gradio for easily creating ML based UI interface. 

## What is needed?
Before starting, make sure you have a couple of things.

1. Account in OpenAI. You can use a free account, but you will get a limited amount of credits that you can use within 3 months. Make sure that you are tracking all of your activities in your account. For more info look here
2. Updated Python version
3. OpenAI installed the package.
4. (Optional) Gradio package for creating UI for ML interactions.
You can see 2 files in the repository. You need a Jupyter notebook for connecting, but I recommend playing with Python files if you want to go further.

Enjoy!
